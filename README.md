Pattern Lab is wicked cool and you should use it! 

## Installation
Once published to npmjs.org, installation will most likely be: `npm install -g pattern-lab-workshop`

Inside that folder type:

`npm install` 

`npm link` 

Make a new folder somewhere else to run the workshop in.

cd into that new folder and type `pattern-lab-workshop` in the terminal.

## Workshop Commands
