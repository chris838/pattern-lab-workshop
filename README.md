# Pattern Lab Workshopper

## Code Example
![terminal menu](assets/terminal-menu.png)
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This workshopper aims to explain the concepts behind Pattern Lab. [http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html]
Pattern Lab is wicked cool and you should use it! 

## Installation
This will change once it's published to npm. 
Once that happens installation will probably be `npm install -g pattern-lab-workshop`

But until then:

git clone the repo
Inside that folder type
`npm install`
`npm link`

Make a new folder somewhere else to run the workshop in.

cd into that folder and type `pattern-lab-workshop` in the terminal.
