# Pattern Lab Workshopper

![terminal menu](assets/terminal-menu.png)

This workshopper aims to explain the concepts behind [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/docs/index.html).
Pattern Lab is wicked cool and you should use it! 

## Installation
This will change once it's published to npm.

Once that happens installation will probably be `npm install -g pattern-lab-workshop`

But until then:

git clone the repo

Inside that folder type:

`npm install` 

`npm link` 

Make a new folder somewhere else to run the workshop in.

cd into that folder and type `pattern-lab-workshop` in the terminal.
