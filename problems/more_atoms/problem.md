For this test, we'll be making another atom. Rome wasn't built in a day. 
Follow the naming convention from before (`02-tutorial-image`),
but this time our atom will be an image with a height and width of 200px.

Be sure to use the `.mustache` extension!

The source for our image can just be `/` for now.
