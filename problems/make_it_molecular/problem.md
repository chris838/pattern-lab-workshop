Atoms and molecules, oh my!
Just like chemistry, atoms in Pattern Lab come together to form molecules.
Because we're using mustache files, 
we can easily combine disparate parts to create a cohesive whole.

For the purposes of this lesson, we will be creating an item molecule.
This molecule will consist of a div that contains two mustache partials, 
one for our image and our button. 

A mustache partial looks like this: `{{> thing }}`

Remember to follow the naming conventions & don't forget to make a new folder for your molecule!
