In interfaces, molecules are groups of elements that function together as a unit. 
For example, a form label, search input, and button atom can combine them together to form a search form molecule.

Building up from atoms to molecules encourages a “do one thing and do it well” mentality, 
and encourages creating reusable interface patterns.

For the purposes of this lesson, we will be creating an item molecule.
This molecule will consist of a div that contains two mustache partials, 
one for our image and our button. 

A mustache partial looks like this: `{{> thing }}`

Remember to follow the naming conventions & don't forget to make a new folder for your molecule!
