Organisms are groups of molecules (and possibly atoms) joined together 
to form distinct section of an interface.

Organisms can consist of similar and/or disparate molecule types.
For example, a masthead organism might consist of a logo, navigation, 
and search form, while a “product grid” organism might consist of the 
same product info molecule repeated over and over.

Building up from molecules to organisms encourages creating standalone, 
portable, reusable components.

Let's turn our item molecule from the last lesson into a product grid 
organism!

This organism will consist of a div that contains three item molecules. 

Remember to follow the naming conventions & don't forget to make a new 
folder for your organism!
