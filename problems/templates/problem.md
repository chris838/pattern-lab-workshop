We break from our chemistry analogy at the template level. 
Templates are used for any generic repeatable page structures, 
like blog posts or individual product pages. 
The actual data gets filled in at the page level, 
but we'll get to that in a future lesson.

Because this is just an example lesson, 
our template will consist of `3 product grids inside of a div`. 
Sound familiar?
Normally, templates would probably also include header & footer organisms
along with anything else our page would need to well, 
be a page. Like a navbar molecule. Think of the possibilities!

I know I'm sounding like a broken record, but...
Don't forget to make a new folder for your templates & remember the naming conventions!

Here's a freebie: Name your template `01-products.mustache`
