With templates, we break our biochemistry analogy to get into language 
that makes more sense to clients and final output. 
Templates are comprised mostly of organisms combined together to form 
page-level objects.

Templates provide context for these relatively abstract molecules and 
organisms, which is helpful for designers and clients alike.

Templates mostly focus on content structure (such as character length, 
image size, etc) rather than the actual content.

Because this is just an example lesson, 
our template will consist of `3 product grids inside of a div`. 
Sound familiar?
Normally, templates would probably also include header & footer organisms
along with anything else our page would need to well, be a page. 
Like a navbar molecule. Think of the possibilities!

I know I'm sounding like a broken record, but...
Don't forget to make a new folder for your templates & remember the naming conventions!

Here's a freebie: Name your template `01-products.mustache`
