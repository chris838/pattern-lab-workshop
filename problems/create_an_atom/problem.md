What is Pattern Lab? 

Pattern Lab is a collection of tools to help you create atomic design systems.

.mustache files provide structure
.json files provide data
.scss files provide styling

This workshopper will show you how to put them all together to create static sites (and so much more!).

If you haven't made a new folder for this workshop, do so now.

Inside of that folder, make another folder named: `atoms`

Make a file called: `01-tutorial-button.mustache` 

containing: `<button>{{ btnText }}</button>`
