What is Pattern Lab? 

Pattern Lab is a collection of tools to help you create atomic design systems.

.mustache files provide the structure.
.json files serve the data.
.scss and .js files add style and functionality.

This workshopper will show you how to put them all together to create static sites (and so much more!).

If you haven't made a new folder for this workshop, do so now.

Inside of that folder, make another folder named: `atoms`

Inside of the atoms folder, make a file called: `01-tutorial-button.mustache` 

containing: `<button>{{ btnText }}</button>`

Your file structure should look something like this: `thisproject/atoms/01-tutorial-button.mustache`

cd to the top-level folder (`thisproject/`) to run the verify & menu commands for all lessons.
