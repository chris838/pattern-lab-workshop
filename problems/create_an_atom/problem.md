What is an atom? Atoms are the basic building blocks of Pattern Lab, little pieces that will be used over and over again throughout your site. 
A good example of atoms are particular sized images, buttons, or form labels. Visit [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/about.html) for more information.

For this lesson, we'll be making a simple button. Save it as "01-tutorial-button.mustache". 
The naming convention seems obtuse, but it's an essential part of how Pattern Lab's magic works.

# For this first problem, we're going to create three things:
 1. Your first atom. 
 2. A folder for atoms to live in (call it 'atoms').
 3. An overall project folder (if you haven't yet created one).
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

Mustache files use html, so <button></button> tags will suffice.

Make those three things in reverse order.

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
